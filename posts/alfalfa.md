# Notes on alfalfa (medicago sativa)

* [2020, Chen et al] [Allele-aware chromosome-level genome assembly and efficient 
  transgene-free genome editing for the autotetraploid cultivated alfalfa](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16338-x)
  * chromosome-aware full sequencing of chinese cultivar XinJiangDaYe
  * sequencing:
	* 70 gigabases (Gb) of PacBio CCS long reads, Sequel platform
	* 126 Gb of Illumina short reads,HiSeq2000 platform
	* 99 Gb ONT (Oxford Nanopore Technology) long reads with average reads length of 16 Kb
  * very good details on sequencing, assembling, quality testing
  * genome and transcriptome sequencing raw data are on NCBI, project [PRJNA540215](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA540215)
  * genome assembly files [available on figshare](https://figshare.com/projects/whole_genome_sequencing_and_assembly_of_Medicago_sativa/66380)
