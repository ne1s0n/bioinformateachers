	* chromosome aware full sequencing of chinese cultivar Zhongmu-4
	* resequencing of 220 germplasms (world collection)
	* sequencing:
		* 262 Gb continuous long reads (CLRs) generated by the PacBio Sequel sequencing system
		* 168 Gb Illumina paired-end sequences (short reads)
	* estimated Zhongmu-4 genome size : 3.1 Gb
	* Repetitive elements drive genome expansion of alfalfa
	* The genome assembly is available on [figshare](https://figshare.com/s/fb4ba8e0b871007a9e6c) and on the [chinese genome warehouse](https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gwh/)
