## BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) models

**BLUP models** are an important example of the application of **mixed linear models** to *life sciences* problems.
BLUP models are of paramount importance in plant and animal breeding: before the advent of affordable high-throughput genomic data (e.g. SNP arrays, RAD-sequencing/GBS etc.), the genetic improvement of crops and farm animal species has relied for decades on BLUP models based on genealogies and phenotypic data (with remarkable results, by the way!).
The BLUP methodology has been pioneered by C.R. Henderson (see for instance @henderson1974general), and is based on a mixed model which, in the simplest case, has the following form:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Xb} + \mathbf{Za} + \mathbf{e}
$$
