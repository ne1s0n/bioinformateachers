# Python - basic skills

These exercises showcase some basic Python concepts, plus the use of most common modules. 

Exercises are in the form of [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and can be either downloaded and run locally or explored online via platforms such as [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (a free Google account is required) or [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks) (a free Kaggle account plus phone verification is required).
